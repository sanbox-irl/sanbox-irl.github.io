## Current Projects

### Fields of Mistria

A fantasy farming / life sim RPG in development in Gamemaker Studio 2, inspired by genre classics Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and Rune Factory. Our Bluesky is [here](https://bsky.app/profile/fieldsofmistria.bsky.social).

I am a designer and the lead programmer, managing three other programmers. I do narrative design and most of the gameplay UX design. I also made several systems within the game, such as the Monsters in the Mines, the pathfinding and schedule system, and the furniture system, among others.

### OMNIO

Shown at Playcrafting NYC in 2024, *OMNIO* is a puzzle game about combining blocks. You can play it online [here](https://sanbox-irl.github.io/2024/03/04/omnio/).
