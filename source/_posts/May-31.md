A good life has no mismatched socks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no socks without pair,
And no duplicate socks either --
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the good life is all lefts and rights.
One day, I will take my wardrobe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pairing each and every sock,
Left and right, left and right, left and right,
and burn out my mismatches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my extraneous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my hand-me-downs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the small socks left behind by lovers gone long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my compression socks which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compressed themselves down to nothing
and one day,
I will burn all my etceteras and all my loose ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet though
